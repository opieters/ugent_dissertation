This is a digital version of my master dissertation, submitted to obtain the degree of Master of Science in Electrical Engineering. 

**Supervisors**: prof. dr. ir. Günther Roelkens and prof. dr. Xin Yin.

**Mentors**: ir. Laurens Breyne, ir. Anton Vasiliev and dr. ir. Xiao Li.

## Acknowledgements

Almost one year ago, I made the decision to do a master dissertation about discrete component design and photonics. Almost one year later, I look gladly back at this excellent decision. The hardware/software co-design did not always go as smoothly as planned, but in the end, it has been an educational experience. I would like to thank my promotors, prof. dr. Xin (Scott) Yin and prof. dr. ir. Günther Roelkens for offering me this opportunity, their feedback and support and access to the labs of IDLab Design and the Photonics Research Group. 

I would also like to express gratitude towards all of the people from both IDLab Design and the Photonics Research Group. Most notably, ir. Laurens Breyne and dr. ir. Xiao (Elber) Li from IDLab Design with their suggestions, feedback and guidance during the design of the various components of the system. I also want to thank ir. Anton Vasiliev and ir. Ruijun Wang from the Photonics Research Group for their insight into the photonics part, suggestions and help during the set-up of different measurements. I would also like to thank ing. Jan Gilles for milling and etching more than five different PCB boards I designed in the coarse of this dissertation. I would also like to thank dr. Bart Coppens for proof reading this dissertation. 

I also want to thank my parents and brother for their support through this busy and challenging period. Last but not least, I would also like to thank my fellow lab students with whom I spent many hours in the lab: Dieter Marijsse, Sander Bastiaens, Jonas Borgmans and Gilles Ackaert. Dieter and I worked closely together, especially in the beginning of this dissertation. I would like to thank him for getting the microcontroller software running whilst I was designing my hardware. This allowed me to start the software side much more efficiently.
